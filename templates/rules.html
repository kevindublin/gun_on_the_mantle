          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>Turns go around the table clockwise, beginning with the final player eliminated from the last game. If this is your first game, the oldest, gruffest player begins.</p>
          <p>Each turn has four possible actions:</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Take a coin</li>
            <li>Exchange a card</li>
            <li>Use a skill from a card</li>
            <li>Take the gun from the mantle</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p><strong>Special Exception</strong></p>
          <p><em>Audible/Fair Exchange:</em> A player cannot use the same skill card (3) turns in a row. At the beginning of the third turn, the player is forced to exchange on the third turn before their turn begins, then proceed with play normally.</p>

            <li>If the player claiming the skill <strong>does reveal</strong> the appropriate card, the challenger loses all of their coins.</li>

          <h3>Winning</h3>
          <p>The gun is used to eliminate another player. When a player is eliminated, their coins are evenly divided between the remaining players with any uneven remainder going to the killer.</p>
          <p>When all other players are eliminated, you may take your own coins and the stash. You win.</p>
